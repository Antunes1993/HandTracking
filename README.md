# Goals 
This project uses Google's artificial intelligence Media Pipe to detect the position of human hands and their joints in an image.
Through hand joint detection, it is possible to use joint positioning information to perform tasks, such as displaying or hiding 
images and changing the volume of the machine's sound.

# Main Files
HandtrackingBasics.py - Basic implementation and tests with media pipe. <br/>
HandtrackingModule.py - Creation of a python module using media pipe hand detector in order to be used in other projects. <br/>
Volume Hand Control.py - Increase or decrease notebook's volume sound according with the distance of first finger and thumb. <br/>
Finger Counting.py - Detecs the number of showed fingers and display corresponding images. <br/>
